Hi. My name is Jasper. (he/him or she/her)

For what's relevant here, my main interests are either C++ and game- and software development
Recently I have started to make games with the Godot engine.
Proud to be a Dutch translator for GodSVG.
My game engine project is currently on hold due to life.
I'm also making a wrapper for the C++ Standard Library... for funsies.

Aside of that I play various instruments, I like nature, I make some amateurish art and I talk to strangers on the internet every now and then.
