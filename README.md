Hi. My name's Jasper. (he/him or she/her)

For what's relevant here, my main interests are game development, C/C++, C#/.NET.

Aside of that I play various instruments, I like nature, I do some amateurish painting and I talk to strangers on the internet every now and then.

Currently learning the Godot Engine and making games in it. I don't think I'll be uploading projects here. But I want to try and contribute to the Godot Engine.

I'm on Discord as: jspi
