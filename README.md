Hi. My name is Jasper. (he/him or she/her)

For what's relevant here, my main interests are game development, C/C++, C#/.NET.
Recently I have started to make games with Godot engine.
Proud to be a Dutch translator for GodSVG.
I'm also homebrewing my own game engine for funsies, and making a wrapper for the C++ STL... for funsies.

Aside of that I play various instruments, I like nature, I do some amateurish painting and I talk to strangers on the internet every now and then.
